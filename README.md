# Road-Lane-Semantic-segmentation
Automatic and accurate detection of road/lane boundaries is very important for autonomous driving vehicles. After applying several heuristic based methods, the next step is to apply machine learning for this task.  Semantic segmentation is the task of individually classfying each pixel in the scene to fit into predefined road categories.
